What does "Opening server on 0.0.0.0:19132" mean?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``0.0.0.0`` means "all IPv4 addresses on the local machine". 
If a host has two ip addresses, ``192.168.1.1`` and ``10.1.2.1``, and a server running on the host listens on ``0.0.0.0``, 
it will be reachable at **both** of those IPs.
