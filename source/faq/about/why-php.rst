Why PHP?
~~~~~~~~

Back in its early days, PocketMine-MP (at the time known as `Pocket Minecraft PHP <https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/commit/ba3524dbc7ea98d305c74f00ea6c9a260402c928>`_) was intended as a **quick prototype** for reverse engineering the Minecraft PE protocol by its creator, `Shoghi Cervantes <https://github.com/shoghicp>`_. It was **never intended** for use on production servers. (`Tweet from @shoghicp <https://twitter.com/shoghicp/status/931944880733081601>`_)

Since PocketMine-MP was the only server software available for Minecraft PE at the time, it quickly grew in popularity and started to be used by thousands of servers.
`Lifeboat Survival Games <https://lbsg.net>`_ was one of the first big servers in Minecraft PE, and it was built using PocketMine-MP.

Today, PocketMine-MP maintains its popularity because it's the oldest and most well known Bedrock server software out there, as well as being really easy to develop plugins for.
