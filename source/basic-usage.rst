Setup Wizard

The first time PocketMine-MP starts, it launches a setup wizard.

The setup wizard will allow you to choose a language, and guide you through setting up basic information about your new server, like its name, the server port, etc.

    You can skip the setup wizard by passing ``--no-wizard`` to ``start.sh``, ``start.cmd`` or ``start.ps1``.
